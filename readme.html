Receptors Decreases Intrinsic Excitability and Promotes Bistability in
a Model of Neuronal Activity. Int J Mol Sci 2020 21, 206

</p>
<p>This code was contributed by David Gall. This is "compatible" fortran so it will probably run on whatever fortran.
compiler you have.
</p>
<p>To run the model on ubuntu you can install a free fortran compiler
with a command like:
</p>
<p>sudo apt install gfortran
</p>
<p>Compile and run with commands like:
</p>
<p>gfortran -o alz5v.exe alz5v.f<br/>
./alz5v.exe
</p>
<p>It takes under half a minute to run and generates some data files which you
can plot in matlab with these example commands
</p>
<pre>
load fort.18
figure
for f=2:12
subplot(3,4,f)
plot(fort(:,1),fort(:,f))
ax=axis()
axis([10000 11000 ax(3) ax(4)])
end
</pre>

<p>An xpp (xppaut) file, nmdaextra.ode, is also included.  After starting you can add a
Voltage plot by selecting V vs T under the "Graphic stuff" menu and
then under Parameters change the Iinj current injection to a larger
value like -10 you can see APs generated by the model (you can select
InitialConds -&gt; Go and Continue to 300):
